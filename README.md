# London interactive guide/map
“Take me by the hand” is an interactive web app designed to explore and discover London. It has three main focuses:
The first one is to help users choose where to go or what to do. In order to do so, we have reduced the possible options to choose from hundreds of places to visit, to six moods/categories. The second one is to give users the possibility to categorise places in an unconventional way. To do so, we enabled full customisation of each place: users can assign/remove moods. This ensures that each user has its own personalised experience. The third focus is to give users a way of having a collection of places they want to visit. To enable this, places can be added to two lists: “Liked” and “Wishlist”. This gives yet another way of personalising the app content and function.
Each place in our database has a name, description, a picture and a few other information, such as opening hours and prices.
There are two main parts in our project: the WebApp and the Map.
In the WebApp, choosing a mood/category shows carousels with a picture and all the other information we have. In addition, there is also a modal which allows to customise the place or add them to a specific list. In the Map, choosing a mood/category will display markers. Users can interact with the map (drag, zoom, rotate etc) and can also interact with the markers. If users hover on them, they will be able to see the place name and a button to customise the place settings.

There are animations for each mood on the home page and also one for romantic mood carousels/map.
